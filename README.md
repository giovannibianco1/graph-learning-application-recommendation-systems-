# Graph learning in recommendation systems

Excited to share another project I completed during my exchange at the University of Technology Sydney! This time, I focused on leveraging machine learning techniques for graph data analysis and applied them to recommendation systems across various scenarios.

By exploring cutting-edge methods, I was able to deepen my understanding of how graph structures can enhance recommendation algorithms, improving their accuracy and adaptability.

Looking forward to applying these insights in future projects! ðŸš€
